# MYP-Hexapod-STLs
Various STLs for the MYP hexapod project.

Part compatibility is based on its prefix.
Parts with "Wkerstens" prefix were designed to work with Wkerstens leg mods for the Hexapod project.
Parts with "MYP" prefix will work with the original MYP designed parts.


Part Descriptions

MYP_Switch_Plus_XT60_Mount_Base.stl / MYP_Switch_Plus_XT60_Mount_Top.stl:
This is a combination toggle switch and XT60 plug mount that attaches to the original MYP frame with 1.6mm or 2mm screws directly into the plastic. As a highly recommended option, you can use heated inserts for 2mm screws. 2mm washers are also highly recommended.
The top part attaches to the bottom with 3mm screws directly into the plastic, or you can use 2mm heated inserts in the base along with 2mm screws to attach the top. Again, washers are recommended. No supports should be needed.

MYP_bottom-cover_HeatInserts.stl:
This is a mod of the original MYP bottom cover designed to accept 2mm heated inserts and 2mm screws. No supports should be needed.

Wkerstens_Bushing_10.15-ID.stl:
This is a bushing that can be used in place of the bearings for Wkerstens leg parts. The busing will provide a stiffer movement which should eliminate, or at least reduce, any servo jitter you may experience. AS the name suggests, the inside diameter of the bushing is 10.15mm. You may experience size differences depending on the printer and/or filamnent used.

Wkerstens_LegCover_Front.stl / Wkerstens_LegCover_Rear.stl:
This is a purely cosmetic option for the Wkerstens leg parts. The "Front" version snaps into the gap in the front part of each femur, while the "Rear" version snaps into the rear gap. It is recommended to print them as you see them, using supports, for the best looking finish.
